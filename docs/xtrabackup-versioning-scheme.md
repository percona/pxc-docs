### Percona XtraDB Cluster 5.7 versioning scheme:

Here is what the numbers in the product version specification mean:

For example, in Percona XtraDB Cluster 5.7.39-31.61

* `5.7.39` - the version of Percona Server for MySQL that Percona XtraDB Cluster is based on

* `31` - the WSREP API version

* `61` - a monolithically growing odd number that increases every time Percona releases a new version of Percona XtraDB Cluster
