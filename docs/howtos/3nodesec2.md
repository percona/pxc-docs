# How to set up a three-node cluster in EC2 environment

This manual assumes you are running three EC2 instances
with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 64-bit.

* `node1`: `10.93.46.58`

* `node2`: `10.93.46.59`

* `node3`: `10.93.46.60`

### Recommendations on launching EC2 instances

1. Select [instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) that support Enhanced Networking functionality. Good network performance critical for synchronous replication used in Percona XtraDB Cluster.

2. When adding instance storage volumes, choose the ones with good I/O performance:

    * instances with NVMe are preferred

    * GP2 SSD are preferred to GP3 SSD volume types due to I/O latency

    * over sized GP2 SSD are preferred to IO1 volume types due to cost

3. Attach Elastic network interfaces with static IPs or assign Elastic IP addresses to your instances. Thereby IP addresses are preserved on instances in case of reboot or restart. This is required as each Percona XtraDB Cluster member includes the `wsrep_cluster_address` option in its configuration which points to other cluster members.

4. Launch instances in different availability zones to avoid cluster downtime in case one of the zones experiences power loss or network connectivity issues.

To set up Percona XtraDB Cluster:

1. Remove Percona XtraDB Cluster and Percona Server for MySQL packages for older versions:

    * Percona XtraDB Cluster 5.6, 5.7

    * Percona Server for MySQL 5.6, 5.7

2. Install Percona XtraDB Cluster as described in [Installing Percona XtraDB Cluster on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS](../install/yum.md#yum).

3. Create data directories:

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ mkdir -p /mnt/data
    $ mysql_install_db --datadir=/mnt/data --user=mysql
    ```

4. Stop the firewall service:

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ service iptables stop
    ```

    !!! note

        Alternatively, you can keep the firewall running, but open ports 3306, 4444, 4567, 4568. For example to open port 4567 on 192.168.0.1:

        ```shell
        iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --source 192.168.0.1/24 --dport 4567 -j ACCEPT
        ```

5. Create `/etc/my.cnf` files:

    Contents of the configuration file on the first node:

    ```text
    [mysqld]
    datadir=/mnt/data
    user=mysql

    binlog_format=ROW

    wsrep_provider=/usr/lib64/libgalera_smm.so
    wsrep_cluster_address=gcomm://10.93.46.58,10.93.46.59,10.93.46.60

    wsrep_cluster_name=trimethylxanthine
    wsrep_sst_method=xtrabackup-v2
    wsrep_node_name=node1

    innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2
    ```

    For the second and third nodes change the following lines:

    ```text
    wsrep_node_name=node2

    wsrep_node_name=node3
    ```

6. Start and bootstrap Percona XtraDB Cluster on the first node:

    ```shell
    [root@pxc1 ~]# systemctl start mysql@bootstrap.service
    ```

    ??? example "Expected output"

        ```{.text .no-copy}
        2014-01-30 11:52:35 23280 [Note] /usr/sbin/mysqld: ready for connections.
        Version: '...'  socket: '/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock'  port: 3306  Percona XtraDB Cluster (GPL), Release ..., Revision ..., wsrep_version
        ```

7. Start the second and third nodes:

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ sudo systemctl start mysql
    ```

    ??? example "Expected output"

        ```{.text .no-copy}

        ```

    When all nodes are in SYNCED state, your cluster is ready.

8. You can try connecting to MySQL on any node and create a database:

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ mysql -uroot
    > CREATE DATABASE hello_tom;
    ```
The new database will be propagated to all nodes.
