# Index of wsrep_provider options

The following variables can be set and checked in the [`wsrep_provider_options`](wsrep-system-index.md#wsrep_provider_options) variable. The value of the variable can be
changed in the *MySQL* configuration file, `my.cnf`, or by setting the variable value in the *MySQL* client.

To change the value in `my.cnf`, the following syntax should be used:

```shell
wsrep_provider_options="variable1=value1;[variable2=value2]"
```

For example to set the size of the Galera buffer storage to 512 MB, specify the following in `my.cnf`:

```shell
wsrep_provider_options="gcache.size=512M"
```

Dynamic variables can be changed from the *MySQL* client using the `SET GLOBAL` command. For example, to change the value of the [`pc.ignore_sb`](wsrep-provider-index.md#pcignore_sb), use the following command:

```{.bash data-prompt="mysql>"}
mysql> SET GLOBAL wsrep_provider_options="pc.ignore_sb=true";
```

more data in it. This variable makes it possible to use [IST (Incremental State Transfer)](glossary.md#ist) when the node rejoins instead of
[SST (State Snapshot Transfer)](glossary.md#sst).

Set this variable on an existing node of the cluster (that will
continue to be part of the cluster and can act as a potential
[donor node](glossary.md#donor-node)). This node continues to retain the write-sets and allows restarting the node to rejoin by using [IST](glossary.md#ist).

      * [Want IST Not SST for Node Rejoins? We Have a Solution!](https://www.percona.com/blog/2018/02/13/no-sst-node-rejoins/)

The [`gcache.freeze_purge_at_seqno`](wsrep-provider-index.md#gcachefreeze_purge_at_seqno) variable takes three values:

**-1 (default)**

No freezing of gcache, the purge operates as normal.

**A valid seqno in gcache**

The freeze purge of write-sets may not be smaller than the selected seqno.
The best way to select an optimal value is to use the value of the
variable :variable:`wsrep_last_applied` from the node that you plan to shut down.

**now**
The freeze purge of write-sets is no less than the smallest seqno currently
in gcache. Using this value results in freezing the gcache-purge instantly.
Use this value if selecting a valid seqno in gcache is difficult.

rather than the total memory occupied by all overflow pages.
Whenever `gcache.keep_pages_count` is set to a non-zero value,
excess overflow pages will be deleted
(starting from the oldest to the newest).

Whenever either the `gcache.keep_pages_count`
or the [`gcache.keep_pages_size`](wsrep-provider-index.md#gcachekeep_pages_size) variable
is updated at runtime to a non-zero value,
cleanup is called on excess overflow pages to delete them.

| Default Value: | 0   |

This variable is used to limit the total size of overflow pages
rather than the count of all overflow pages.
Whenever `gcache.keep_pages_size` is set to a non-zero value,
excess overflow pages will be deleted
(starting from the oldest to the newest)
until the total size is below the specified value.

Whenever either the [`gcache.keep_pages_count`](wsrep-provider-index.md#gcachekeep_pages_count) or the `gcache.keep_pages_size` variable
is updated at runtime to a non-zero value,
cleanup is called on excess overflow pages to delete them.

| Dynamic:       | No                 |
| Default Value: | 128M   |

Size of the transaction cache for Galera replication. This defines the size of
the `galera.cache` file which is used as source for [IST](glossary.md#ist). The bigger the
value of this variable, the better are chances that the re-joining node will
get IST instead of [SST](glossary.md#sst).

### `gcomm.thread_prio`

Using this option, you can raise the priority of the gcomm thread to a higher
level than it normally uses.

The format for this variable is: &#60;policy&#62;:&#60;priority&#62;. The priority value is an integer.

other

    Default time-sharing scheduling in Linux. The threads can run
    until blocked by an I/O request or preempted by higher priorities or
    superior scheduling designations.

fifo

    First-in First-out (FIFO) scheduling. These threads always immediately
    preempt any currently running other, batch or idle threads. They can run
    until they are either blocked by an I/O request or preempted by a FIFO thread
    of a higher priority.

rr

    Round-robin scheduling. These threads always preempt any currently running
    other, batch or idle threads. The scheduler allows these threads to run for a
    fixed period of a time. If the thread is still running when this time period is
    exceeded, they are stopped and moved to the end of the list, allowing another
    round-robin thread of the same priority to run in their place. They can
    otherwise continue to run until they are blocked by an I/O request or are
    preempted by threads of a higher priority.

| Default Value: | 100   |

This variable is used for replication flow control. Replication is paused when
the replica queue exceeds this limit. In the default operation mode, flow control
limit is dynamically recalculated based on the amount of nodes in the
cluster, but this recalculation can be turned off with use of the [`gcs.fc_master_slave`](wsrep-provider-index.md#gcsfc_master_slave) variable to make manual setting of the [`gcs.fc_limit`](wsrep-provider-index.md#gcsfc_limit) having an effect  (e.g., for configurations when writing is done to a single node in Percona XtraDB Cluster).

| Dynamic:       | No                 |
| Default Value: | true   |

When this variable is set to `true`, the node stores the Primary Component
state to disk. The Primary Component can then recover automatically when all
nodes that were part of the last saved state re-establish communication with
each other. This feature allows automatic recovery from full cluster crashes,
such as in the case of a data center power outage. A subsequent graceful full
cluster restart will require explicit bootstrapping for a new Primary
Component.

### `pc.version`

| Option         | Description        |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Command Line:  | Yes                |

| Dynamic:       | No                 |
| Default Value: | true   |

When set to `TRUE`, the node waits for a primary component for the period of
time specified in [`pc.wait_prim_timeout`](wsrep-provider-index.md#pcwait_prim_timeout). This is useful to bring up a non-primary component and make it primary with [`pc.bootstrap`](wsrep-provider-index.md#pcbootstrap).
