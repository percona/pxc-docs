## Release Highlights

Percona XtraDB Cluster is based on Percona Server for MySQL. Find a complete list of improvements and bug fixes in the [Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.39-42 (2022-08-15)](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/5.7/release-notes/Percona-Server-5.7.39-42.html). 

The improvements and bug fixes for MySQL 5.7.39, provided by Oracle, and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* Enable the `performance_schema_show_processlist` system variable to use an alternative implementation of the `SHOW PROCESSLIST` statement. Instead of querying the thread manager and holding a global mutex, which may affect performance, this implementation queries the active thread data from the Performance Schema and does not require a mutex. 
  
  A fresh installation of MySQL 5.7.39 or higher automatically creates the `processlist` table. This table is not automatically created during an upgrade. For an upgrade, you must [create the table manually](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/performance-schema-processlist-table.html#performance-schema-processlist-table-creating). 
  
* The system variable, `myisam_repair_threads`, and the myisamchk [`--parallel-recover` option](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/myisamchk-repair-options.html#option_myisamchk_parallel-recover) are removed.
