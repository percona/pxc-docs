## Release highlights

Percona XtraDB Cluster is based on Percona Server for MySQL. Find a complete list of improvements and bug fixes in the [Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.34-26 (2023-09-26) release notes](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.0/release-notes/8.0.34-26.html).

Percona XtraDB Cluster implements telemetry that fills in the gaps in our understanding of how you use Percona XtraDB Cluster to improve our products. Participation in the anonymous program is optional. You can opt-out if you prefer not to share this information. Find more information in the [Telemetry on Percona XtraDB Cluster](../telemetry.md) document.

Improvements and bug fixes introduced by Oracle for MySQL 8.0.34 and included in Percona XtraDB Cluster are the following:

* Adds `mysql_binlog_open()`, `mysql_binlog_fetch()`, and `mysql_binlog_close()` functions to the libmysqlclient.so shared library. These functions enable developers to access a MySQL server binary log.

* For platforms on which OpenSSL libraries are bundled, the linked OpenSSL library for MySQL Server is updated from OpenSSL 1.1.1 to OpenSSL 3.0.9.

### Deprecations and removals

* The `mysqlpump` client utility program is deprecated. The use of this program causes a warning. The `mysqlpump` client may be removed in future releases. The applications that depend on `mysqlpump` will use `mysqldump` or `MySQL Shell Utilities`.

* The `sync_relay_log_info` server system variable is deprecated. Using this variable or its equivalent startup `--sync-relay-log-info` option causes a warning. This variable may be removed in future releases. The applications that use this variable should be rewritten not to depend on it before the variable is removed.

* The `binlog_format` server system variable is deprecated and may be removed in future releases. The functionality associated with this variable, which changes the binary logging format, is also deprecated. 

    When `binlog_format` is removed, MySQL server supports only row-based binary logging. Thus, new installations should use only row-based binary logging. Migrate the existing installations that use the statement-based or mixed logging format to the row-based format.

    The system variables `log_bin_trust_function_creators` and `log_statements_unsafe_for_binlog` used in the context of statement-based logging are also deprecated and may be removed in future releases.

    Setting or selecting the values of deprecated variables causes a warning.

* The `mysql_native_password` authentication plugin is deprecated and may be removed in future releases. Using `CREATE USER`, `ALTER USER`, and `SET PASSWORD` operations, insert a deprecation warning into the server error log if an account attempts to authenticate using `mysql_native_password` as an authentication method.

* The `keyring_file` and `keyring_encrypted_file` plugins are deprecated. These keyring plugins are replaced with the `component_keyring_file` and `component_keyring_encrypted_file` components.

## Bug fixes

* [PXC-4219](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-4219): Starting a Percona XtraBackup process and issuing a `START REPLICA` command simultaneously could deadlock the server.

* [PXC-4238](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-4238): Running either the `asynchronous_connection_failover_add_source` user defined function or the `asynchronous_connection_failover_delete_source` user defined function generated an errant transaction, which could prevent a failover in the future.

* [PXC-4255](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-4255): Running `ALTER USER/SET PASSWORD` and `FLUSH PRIVILEGES` simultaneously on different Percona XtraDB Cluster nodes stalled the cluster.

* [PXC-4284](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-4284): If a MySQL user was not created before the GRANT option, the Percona XtraDB Cluster node was disconnected and needed a complete state transfer ([SST](..//glossary.md#sst)).

* [PXC-4288](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-4288): Galera Arbitrator (garbd) used 100% CPU.

* [PXC-4302](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-4302): The GRANT statement could be replicated in a wrong way if `partial_revokes=1` was enabled.

* [PXC-4310](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-4310): A warning message had an incorrect link.

* [PXC-4296](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-4296): The garbd 8.0.33 reported a wrong version.
