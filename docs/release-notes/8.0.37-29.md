Improvements and bug fixes provided by Oracle for MySQL 8.0.37 and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* The redo log might not record a change in column order when using instant DDL, potentially leading to an inaccurate log replay during the recovery process. (Bug #35183686)

* Enhanced management of buffers has been implemented in deleting tablespaces to prevent a possible assertion failure. (Bug #35676106, Bug #36343647)

* Resolved an assertion failure associated with full-text indexes. (Bug #35836581)

## Bug fixes

* [PXC-4173](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4173): Percona XtraDB Cluster node stopped when parallel replication workers were executing Data Definition Language (DDL) commands via asynchronous node.

* [PXC-4313](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4313): Statements executed in a mode when operations are not replicated generated local Global Transaction Identifier (GTID) events.

* [PXC-4363](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4363): Concurrent CREATE and DROP USER queries on different nodes resulted in a permanent lock.

* [PXC-4385](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4385): In the Total Order Isolation mode, an ALTER USER in one mode and a SET PASSWORD in another mode caused statements to hang which locked the nodes.

* [PXC-4397](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4397): The instance became unresponsive if ALTER DATABASE and DROP TRIGGER commands were run simultaneously.

* [PXC-4401](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4401): The function galera::ReplicatorSMM::replicate() contained a duplicate GU_DBUG_SYNC_WAIT("before_replicate_sync") command.

* [PXC-4403](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4403): Incorrect field metadata caused assertion in protocol_classic.cc::store_string().

* [PXC-4419](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4419): A node became unresponsive if DROP USER commands were executed on different nodes.

* [PXC-4428](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4428): When the State Snapshot Transfer (SST) completed, the Galera Arbitrator Daemon (garbd) also terminated any SST subprocesses.

* [PXC-4453](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4453): Constant and frequent changes of the flow control's parameter `gcs.fc_limit` may hang the cluster.
