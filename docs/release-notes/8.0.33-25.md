## Release highlights

Percona XtraDB Cluster is based on Percona Server for MySQL. Find a complete list of improvements and bug fixes in the [Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.33-25 (2023-06-15) release notes](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.0/release-notes/8.0.33-25.html).

Improvements and bug fixes introduced by Oracle for MySQL 8.0.33 and included in Percona XtraDB Cluster are the following:

* The `INSTALL COMPONENT` includes the `SET` clause. The `SET` clause sets the values of component system variables when installing one or several components. This reduces the inconvenience and limitations associated with assigning variable values in other ways.

* The mysqlbinlog `--start-position` accepts values up to `18446744073709551615`. If the `--read-from-remote-server` or `--read-from-remote-source` option is used, the maximum is `4294967295`. (Bug #77818, Bug #21498994)

* Using a generated column with `DEFAULT(col_name)` to specify the default value for a named column is not allowed and throws an error message. (Bug #34463652, Bug #34369580)

* Not all possible error states were reported during the binary log recovery process. (Bug #33658850)

* User-defined collations are deprecated. The usage of the following user-defined collations causes a warning that is written to the log:

  * When `COLLATE` is followed by the name of a user-defined collation in an SQL statement.

  * When the name of a user-defined collation is used as the value of `collation_server`, `collation_database`, or `collation_connection`.

The support for user-defined collations will be removed in a future releases of MySQL.
