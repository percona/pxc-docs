* In certain scenarios, a MySQL server connection could fail if the .ibd file for the partition was missing.

* A statement was not written to the slow query log if the statement contained errors and could not be parsed.

## Bugs Fixed

* [PXC-3118](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-3118): A fix for when, using a thread pool, a brute force abort for a metadata locking (MDL) subsystem conflict stalled.

* [PXC-3951](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-3951): Updated how sst-idle-timeout calculates disk usage. The default timeout value for the variable is 120 seconds. If the joiner node does not detect a disk usage difference in that time, the node terminates the SST. The current calculation could return the same value for 120 seconds.

* [PXC-2367](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-2367): When enabled, the event scheduler filled the error logs with a “Ready state reached” message. The message’s logging level was reduced to “debug” and only logged in the error logs when wsrep_debug = 1.

* [PXC-3961](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-3961): Reduced the strictness of checks which had marked GNo=0 invalid. In Percona XtraDB Cluster, writesets are replicated to other nodes with GNo=0. The generation of seqno or GTID occurs later in the pre-commit phase. A recent version had increased the strictness of these checks which caused the GTID event from 5.6 to be considered invalid.
