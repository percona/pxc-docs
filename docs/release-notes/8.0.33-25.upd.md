## Known issues

If you use Galera Arbitrator (garbd), we recommend that you do not upgrade to 8.0.33 because `garbd-8.0.33` may cause synchronization issues and extensive usage of CPU resources.

If you already upgraded to `garbd-8.0.33`, we recommended downgrading to `garbd-8.0.32-24-2` by performing the following steps:

* Uninstall the `percona-xtradb-cluster-garbd_8.0.33-25` package.

* Download the `percona-xtradb-cluster-garbd_8.0.32-24-2` package from [Percona Software Downloads](https://www.percona.com/downloads) manually.

* Install the `percona-xtradb-cluster-garbd_8.0.32-24-2` package manually.
