## Release highlights

Percona XtraDB Cluster is based on Percona Server for MySQL. Find a complete list of improvements and bug fixes in the [Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.32-24 (2023-03-20) release notes](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.0/release-notes/8.0.32-24.html).

Percona decided to revert the following MySQL bug fix:

The data and the GTIDs backed up by mysqldump were inconsistent when the options `--single-transaction` and `--set-gtid-purged=ON` were both used. It was because in between the transaction started by mysqldump and the fetching of GTID_EXECUTED, GTIDs on the server could have increased already. With this fixed, a FLUSH TABLES `WITH READ LOCK` is performed before the fetching of `GTID_EXECUTED` to ensure its value is consistent with the snapshot taken by mysqldump.

The MySQL fix also added a requirement when using [--single-transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqldump.html#option_mysqldump_single-transaction) and executing FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK for the [RELOAD](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_reload) privilege. ([MySQL bug #109701](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=109701), [MySQL bug #105761](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=105761))

The Percona Server version of the `mysqldump` utility, in some modes, can be used with MySQL Server. This utility provides a temporary workaround for the "additional RELOAD privilege" limitation introduced by Oracle MySQL Server 8.0.32. 

For more information, see the Percona Performance Blog [A Workaround for the "RELOAD/FLUSH_TABLES privilege required" Problem When Using Oracle mysqldump 8.0.32](https://www.percona.com/blog/workaround-for-the-reload-flush_tables-privilege-required-problem-when-using-oracle-mysqldump-8-0-32/).

Improvements and bug fixes introduced by Oracle for MySQL 8.0.32 and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* A replica can add a Generated Invisible Primary Keys(GIPK) to any InnoDB table. To achieve this behavior, the `GENERATE` value is added as a possible value for the `CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO` statementâ€™s `REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK` option.

* The `REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK = GENERATE` option can be used on a per-channel basis.

* Setting `sql_generate_invisible_primary_key` on the source is ignored by a replica because this variable is not replicated. This behavior is inherited from the previous releases.

* An upgrade from 8.0.28 caused undetectable problems, such as server exit and corruption.

* A fix for after an upgrade, all columns added with `ALGORITHM=INSTANT` materialized and have `version=0` for any new row inserted. Now, a column added with `ALGORITHM=INSTANT` fails if the maximum possible size of a row exceeds the row size limit, so that all new rows with materialized `ALGORITHM=INSTANT` columns are within row size limit. (Bug #34558510)

* After a drop, adding a specific column using the INSTANT algorithm could cause a data error and a server exit. (Bug #34122122)

* An online rebuild DDL no longer crashes after a column is added with `ALGORITHM=INSTANT`. Thank you Qingda Hu for reporting this bug. (Bug #33788578, Bug #106279)

## Bug fixes

* [PXC-3936](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-3936): State transfer with disabled SSL in `wsrep_provider_options` option crashed the Receiver and Donor nodes.

* [PXC-3976](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-3976): The `wsrep` status `vars` were not updated when 8.0 node joined the 5.7 cluster.

* [PXC-4137](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-4137): The `WSREP` applier threads failed to modify read-only schemas.

* [PXC-4162](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-4162): When doing a rolling upgrade from 5.7 to 8.0, `wsrep_cluster_size` was 0.

* [PXC-4163](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-4163): The `pxc_strict_mode` option did not detect version mismatch.
