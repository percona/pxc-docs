* Upgraded the linked OpenSSL library to OpenSSL 3.0.10.
* Removed the printed query string limit to display the characters for a detected deadlock section of the engine status log.
* Fixed a procession of single-character tokens by an FTS parser plugin.

### Deprecations

A future release may remove deprecated variables and options. The usage of these deprecated items may cause a warning. We recommend migrating from deprecated variables and options as soon as possible.

This release deprecates the following variables and options:

* The `binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking` server system variable

* The `old` and `new` server system variables

* The `--character-set-client-handshake` server variable

* `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST`

* The implementation of the `SHOW PROCESSLIST` command that uses the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST` table

* The `performance_schema_show_processlist` variable

## Bug fixes

* [PXC-4343](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4343): The table spaces were corrupted during SST that caused the Xtrabackup failure with the `Header page contains inconsistent data in datafile` error (Thanks to Andrew Garner for his help in fixing this issue.)

* [PXC-4336](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4336): The Percona XtraDB Cluster node disconnected from the cluster due to CHECK CONSTRAINT.

* [PXC-4332](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4332): The Percona XtraDB Cluster node disconnected from the cluster if the local variable was changed at the session level.

* [PXC-4318](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4318): The Percona XtraDB Cluster node can serve as an async replica for another master node. However, when the same row was modified on both the Percona XtraDB Cluster node and the master node, the Percona XtraDB Cluster node got stuck due to replication conflicts.

* [PXC-4317](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4317): On newer platforms like AlmaLinux, adding a new node to an existing cluster was unsuccessful because the readlink command used during the SST process on joiner failed (Thanks to Mikael Gbai for reporting this issue.)

* [PXC-4315](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4315): The logs like `MDL conflict ... solved by abort` were printed, but no transaction was aborted (Thanks to Arkadiusz Petruczynik for reporting this issue.)

* [PXC-4312](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4312): When DROP EVENT IF EXISTS was executed for non existing event, the event was binlogged with the GTID containing UUID of local server instead of global cluster-wide UUID.

* [PXC-4298](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4298): The node was disconnected when using `ALTER TABLE`, including `ADD UNIQUE` in the table containing duplicate entries (Thanks to Vit Novak for reporting this issue.)

* [PXC-4237](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4237): `wsrep_sst_xtrabackup-v2` failed when adding a new node.

* [PXC-4179](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4179): The wsrep applier threads and rollbacker threads were not reported by `performance_schema.processlist`.

* [PXC-4034](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4034): The usage of `sql_log_bin=0` broke GTID consistency.
