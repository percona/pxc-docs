# Percona XtraDB Cluster 5.7.37-31.57 (2022-05-18)

Percona XtraDB Cluster (PXC) supports critical business applications in your public, private, or hybrid cloud environment. Our free, open source, enterprise-grade solution includes the high availability and security features your business requires to meet your customer expectations and business goals.

## Release Highlights

The following lists a number of the notable updates and fixes for MySQL 5.7.37, provided by Oracle, and included in Percona Server for MySQL:


* The performance on debug builds has been improved by optimizing the buf_validate() function in the *InnoDB* sources.


* Fix for when a query using an index that differs from the primary key of the partitioned table results in excessive CPU load.


* Enabling `PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH` SQL mode on a replica server added trailing spaces to a replication channelâ€™s name in the replication metadata repository tables. Attempts to identify the channel using the padded name caused errors. The SQL mode is disabled when reading from those tables.
