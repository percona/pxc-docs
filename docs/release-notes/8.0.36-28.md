## Bug fixes

* [PXC-4316](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4316): If the node shut down while being partitioned from the cluster, started again, and then rejoined the cluster, the other part of the cluster would still wait for the partitioned node.

* [PXC-4341](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4341): When running `FLUSH TABLES` after a statement was prepared, the node could exit due to broken consistency.

* [PXC-4348](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4348): The joiner node exited with Metadata Lock `BF-BF` conflict during `IST`.

* [PXC-4362](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4362): The node could leave the cluster when binary logging was enabled and the function was created without super privilege.

* [PXC-4365](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4365): The node could leave the cluster when the row size was too large and had more than three `nvarchar` columns.

* [PXC-4340](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PXC-4340): The server exited when executing the complicated query with 9 CTEs.
