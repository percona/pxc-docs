## Release highlights

Percona XtraDB Cluster is based on Percona Server for MySQL. Find a complete list of improvements and bug fixes in the [Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.30-22 (2022-11-21) release notes](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.0/release-notes/8.0.30-22.html).

!!! note

    The following Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.30 features are not supported in this version of Percona XtraDB Cluster: 

    * [Amazon Key Management Service](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.0/security/using-amz-kms.html)
  
    * [Key Management Interoperability Protocol](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.0/security/using-kmip.html)

    The features will be supported in the next version of Percona XtraDB Cluster.

Improvements and bug fixes introduced by Oracle for *MySQL* 8.0.30 and included in *Percona Server for MySQL* are the following:

* Supports Generated Invisible Primary Keys(GIPK). This feature automatically adds a primary key to InnoDB tables without a primary key. The generated key is always named `my_row_id`. The GIPK feature is not enabled by default. Enable the feature by setting `sql_generate_invisible_primary_key` to ON.

* The InnoDB_doublewrite system has two new settings:

  * `DETECT_ONLY`. This setting allows only metadata to be written to the doublewrite buffer. Database page content is not written to the buffer. Recovery does not use the buffer to fix incomplete page writes. Use this setting only when you need to detect incomplete page writes.

  * `DETECT_AND_RECOVER`. This setting is equivalent to the current ON setting. The doublewrite buffer is enabled. Database page content is written to the buffer and the buffer is accessed to fix incomplete page writes during recovery.

* The `-skip_host_cache` server option is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use `SET GLOBAL host_cache_size`= 0 or set `host_cache_size` = 0.

## Bug fixes

* [PXC-3639](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-3639): The buffer overflow was not considered when using `strncpy` in `WSREP` patch. 

* [PXC-3821](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-3821): The truncation of the `performance_schema` table on a node was replicated across the cluster.

* [PXC-4012](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-4012): The replica node left the cluster when executing `CREATE USER` with `password_history` option simultaneously.

* [PXC-4033](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-4033): When the prepared statement is executed in parallel to the DDL modifying the table that the prepared statement uses, the server fails with an assertion saying that the prepared statement transaction was aborted, so it cannot be committed.

* [PXC-4048](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-4048): `gra_x_y_v2.log` files created in case of failures were empty.
