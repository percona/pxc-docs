## Release Highlights

The following are a number of the notable fixes for MySQL 8.0.26, provided by Oracle, and included in this release:


* The TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 connection protocols are deprecated.


* Identifiers with specific terms, such as “master” or “slave” are deprecated and replaced. See the [Functionality Added or Changed section in the 8.0.26 Release Notes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/news-8-0-26.html#mysqld-8-0-26-feature) for a list of updated identifiers. The following terms have been changed:

  * The identifier `master` is changed to `source`

  * The identifier `slave` is changed to `replica`

  * The identifier `multithreaded slave` (`mts`) is changed to `multithreaded applier` (`mta`)


* When using semisynchronous replication, either the old version or the new version of system variables and status variables are available. You cannot have both versions installed on an instance. The old system variables are available when you use the old version, but the new ones are not. The new system variables are available when you use the new version, but the old values are not.

In an upgrade from an earlier version to 8.0.26, enable the `rpl_semi_sync_source` plugin and the `rpl_semi_sync_replica` plugin after the upgrade has been completed. Enabling these plugins before all of the nodes are upgraded may cause data inconsistency between the nodes.

For the source, the `rpl_semi_sync_master` plugin (`seminsync_master.so` library) is the old version and the `rpl_semi_sync_source` plugin(`semisync_source.so` library) is the new version.

For the client, the `rpl_semi_sync_slave` plugin (`semisync_slave.so` library) is the old version and the `rpl_semi_sync_replica` plugin (`semisync_replica.so` library) is the new version
