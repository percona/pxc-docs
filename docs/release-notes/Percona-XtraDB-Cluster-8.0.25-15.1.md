Our free, open source, enterprise-grade solution includes the high availability and security features your business requires to meet your customer expectations and business goals.

## Release Highlights

A Non-Blocking Operation method for online schema changes in Percona XtraDB Cluster. This mode is similar to the Total Order Isolation (TOI) mode, whereas a data definition language (DDL) statement (for example, `ALTER`) is executed on all nodes in sync. The difference is that in the NBO mode, the DDL statement acquires a metadata lock that locks the table or schema at a late stage of the operation, which is a more efficient locking strategy.

Note that the NBO mode is a **Tech Preview** feature. We do not recommend that you use this mode in a production environment. For more information, see [Non-Blocking Operations (NBO) method for Online Scheme Upgrades (OSU)](/nbo.md#nbo).

The notable changes and bug fixes introduced by Oracle MySQL include the following:


* The `sql_slave_skip_counter` variable only counts the events in the uncompressed transaction payloads.


* A possible deadlock occurred when system variables, read by different clients, were being updated and the binary log file was rotated.


* Sometimes the aggregate function results could return values from a previous statement when using a prepared `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause that is always false.

For more information, see the [MySQL 8.0.24 Release Notes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/news-8-0-24.html) and the [MySQL 8.0.25 Release Notes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/news-8-0-25.html).
