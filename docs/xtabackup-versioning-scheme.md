### Percona XtraDB Cluster 8.0 versioning scheme:

Here is what the numbers in the product version specification mean:

For example, in Percona XtraDB Cluster 8.0.29-21

* `8.0.29` - the version of Percona Server for MySQL that Percona XtraDB Cluster is based on

* `21` - a sequential number that increases every time Percona releases a new version of Percona XtraDB Cluster

Percona can relese several Percona XtraDB Cluster versions based on the same Percona Server for MySQL version. For example, Percona XtraDB Cluster 8.0.20-11.1, 8.0.20-11.2, and 8.0.20-11.3 are based on Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.20.
